        I'm Luca Mazzarello, a full stack developer based in Argentina. I've always been
        passionate about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.
        I find it incredibly satisfying to create digital experiences that are both
        functional and enjoyable to use.

        When I'm not coding, I love to explore new technologies and contribute to
        open source projects. I'm always seeking out new challenges and experiences,
        both in my personal life and in my development work.
